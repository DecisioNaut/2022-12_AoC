Finally, and for the first year, I found some time to take part in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)!  

The Advent of Code is a yearly, seasonal series of **coding puzzles**:
- **Every day**, from the 1st to the 25th of December, a new puzzle is being published. 
- Every puzzle has **two related parts**:
    - First, ... mmmh ... the first is presented and wants to be solved. The puzzle contains an example, but finally your own version of input data.
    - If the first is solved, you get to the second phase - if your code from the first part is flexible, it's gonna be a breeze; if not, you need to work a bit more.
    - For every part solved, you earn a star.
- Participants need to sign-up and then get their own versions/input data as described above.

> **Warning**  
> Don't spoil your own fun by copy-pasting my solutions contained in this repo!  

> **Note**  
> This repos doesn't need anything but Python 3.11
