Finally, and for the first year, found some time to take part in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)!
The Advent of Code is a yearly, seasonal series of coding puzzles. Every day, from the 1st to the 25th of December, a new puzzle gets published. Participants need to sign-up and then get their own versions/input data.
